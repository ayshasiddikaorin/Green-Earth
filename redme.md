## 1) Difference between `var`, `let`, and `const`  
- `var`: Function-scoped, can be redeclared, hoisted.  
- `let`: Block-scoped, cannot be redeclared, value can be updated.  
- `const`: Block-scoped, cannot be redeclared or updated.  



## 2) Difference between `map()`, `forEach()`, and `filter()`  
- `map()`: Creates a new array by transforming each element.  
- `forEach()`: Iterates over array elements, returns nothing.  
- `filter()`: Creates a new array with elements that pass a condition.  



## 3) What are arrow functions in ES6?


- Shorter syntax for functions.
- this comes from parent scope.
- Cannot be used as constructors.




## 4) How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?

In ES6, destructuring assignment allows you to extract values from arrays or objects and assign them to variables in a very concise way. For arrays, you can assign elements to variables based on their position, and for objects, you can assign properties to variables with matching names. This feature makes the code cleaner and easier to read, especially when working with multiple values from arrays or objects.
